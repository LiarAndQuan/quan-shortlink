# this config is to ignore lombok code in jacoco
config.stopBubbling = true
lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation = true

# fix @Data callSuper=false
lombok.equalsAndHashCode.callSuper = skip

#当我们给一个继承了父类的子类上使用@Data @ToString @EqualsAndHashCode 注解时，IDE 会警告
#
#Generating equals/hashCode implementation but without a call to superclass
#
#意思是，该注解在实现 ToString EqualsAndHashCode 方法时，不会考虑父类的属性，通过反编译的源码也是可以看到他是没有对父类的字段进行比较的
#
#子类实体的equals/hasCode方法无法继承父类属性
